# AI_Virtual_Touchpad

Welcome to the AI Virtual Touchpad project! This repository showcases an innovative application of computer vision and artificial intelligence using OpenCV to create a virtual touchpad. 

The goal of this project is to enable users to control a virtual interface using hand gestures, providing a touchless interaction experience that could be particularly useful in environments where physical contact with devices is not feasible or desirable.
